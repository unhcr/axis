# Collections

The two folders in the directory are `parameters` and `syncables`. `syncables` is a name due to legacy reasons, but is where all the collections for data can be found. For example, `Budget` and `Expenditure` are examples of syncables. The `parameters` are the Results Based Management parameters like `Operation`, `Ppg`, `Goal` etc.
